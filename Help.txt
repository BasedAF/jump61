Commands may be in any mixture of case.  You may abbreviate commands
(but not moves) with any unique prefix (e.g., 'c' for 'clear').
Commands:
  <row> <column>   Put piece on given row and column (integers, row 1 is
                   topmost, column 1 is leftmost).
  board            Print a version of the board with row and column numbers.
  clear            Stop any game.  Clear board to starting position.
  size <N>         Stop any game, set game board to N on a side, and clear the
                   board to the starting position.
  start            Start a new game or restart a suspended one.
  new              Short for clear followed by start.
  auto <P>         Stop any game.  Player <P>'s moves (<P>=Red or Blue)
                   will be made by an an automated (AI) player when game
                   (re)starts.  By default, Blue is an AI.
  manual <P>       Stop any game. Player <P>'s moves will be taken from
                   the terminal when game (re)starts. By default, Red is
                   a manual player.
  level <n> <P>    Sets player <P> to an AI of level <n> (that is,
                   tells player <P>'s algorithm to look <n> moves
                   ahead when it evaluates a board).

  seed <N>         Seed the pseudo-random number generator used by automated
